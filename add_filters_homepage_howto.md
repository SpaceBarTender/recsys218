I'll help you add additional filters to your application. Based on the code, you'll need to modify both the `fetch_articles` function and the `/api/recommendations` endpoint. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. First, let's look at the current `fetch_articles` function. It currently handles:
   - Topics (array and text field)
   - Date minimum
   - Article titles
   - Pagination (offset and limit)

2. To add new filters, you'll need to:

   a. Modify the `fetch_articles` function to accept and handle the new filters
   b. Update the `/api/recommendations` endpoint to pass these filters
   c. Update the `/api/articles/filter` endpoint to handle the new filters

Here's a detailed example of how to add a new filter (let's say we want to add an "author" filter):

1. First, modify the `fetch_articles` function to accept the new filter:

```python
def fetch_articles(conn, topics=None, date_min=None, articles=None, authors=None, offset=0, limit=10):
    print(f"[DEBUG] Fetching articles with filters - topics: {topics}, date_min: {date_min}, articles: {articles}, authors: {authors}")
    
    query = """
        SELECT uc.*
        FROM urls_content uc
        WHERE 1=1
    """
    params = []
    
    # Existing filters...
    if topics and len(topics) > 0:
        topic_conditions = []
        for topic in topics:
            topic_conditions.append("uc.topics_array && ARRAY[%s]::text[]")
            topic_conditions.append("uc.topics ILIKE %s")
            params.extend([topic, f"%{topic}%"])
        query += " AND (" + " OR ".join(topic_conditions) + ")"
    
    if date_min:
        try:
            if isinstance(date_min, str):
                date_min = datetime.strptime(date_min, '%Y-%m-%d')
            query += " AND uc.publication_date >= %s"
            params.append(date_min)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"[WARNING] Invalid date format: {date_min}, skipping date filter")
    
    if articles and len(articles) > 0:
        title_conditions = []
        for article in articles:
            title_conditions.append("uc.title ILIKE %s")
            params.append(f"%{article}%")
        query += " AND (" + " OR ".join(title_conditions) + ")"

    # New author filter
    if authors and len(authors) > 0:
        author_conditions = []
        for author in authors:
            author_conditions.append("uc.author ILIKE %s")
            params.append(f"%{author}%")
        query += " AND (" + " OR ".join(author_conditions) + ")"
    
    query += " ORDER BY uc.publication_date DESC LIMIT %s OFFSET %s"
    params.extend([limit, offset])
    
    print(f"[DEBUG] Final query: {query}")
    print(f"[DEBUG] Query params: {params}")
    
    try:
        with conn.cursor() as cur:
            cur.execute(query, params)
            columns = [desc[0] for desc in cur.description]
            results = [dict(zip(columns, row)) for row in cur.fetchall()]
            print(f"[DEBUG] Found {len(results)} articles")
            return results
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"[ERROR] Database error in fetch_articles: {str(e)}")
        print(f"[ERROR] Query that failed: {query}")
        print(f"[ERROR] Parameters used: {params}")
        raise e
```

2. Update the `/api/recommendations` endpoint to handle the new filter:

```python
@app.post("/api/recommendations")
def get_recommendations(data: dict = Body(...), authorization: str = Header(None, alias="Authorization")):
    # ... existing validation code ...

    try:
        # ... existing session validation code ...

        # Get filters from request
        topics = data.get("topics", [])
        date_min = data.get("date_min")
        articles = data.get("articles", [])
        authors = data.get("authors", [])  # New filter

        # Fetch articles with filters
        all_articles = fetch_articles(
            conn, 
            topics=topics, 
            date_min=date_min, 
            articles=articles,
            authors=authors,  # Pass the new filter
            offset=0, 
            limit=999999
        )

        # ... rest of the existing code ...
```

3. Update the `/api/articles/filter` endpoint to handle the new filter:

```python
@app.post("/api/articles/filter")
def filter_articles(data: dict = Body(...), authorization: str = Header(None, alias="Authorization")):
    # ... existing validation code ...

    try:
        # ... existing session validation code ...

        # Handle existing filters
        topics = data.get("topics", [])
        if isinstance(topics, str):
            try:
                topics = json.loads(topics)
            except Exception as e:
                topics = []
        if not isinstance(topics, list):
            topics = []
        
        articles = data.get("articles", [])
        if isinstance(articles, str):
            try:
                articles = json.loads(articles)
            except Exception as e:
                articles = []
        if not isinstance(articles, list):
            articles = []

        # Handle new authors filter
        authors = data.get("authors", [])
        if isinstance(authors, str):
            try:
                authors = json.loads(authors)
            except Exception as e:
                authors = []
        if not isinstance(authors, list):
            authors = []

        # ... existing date filter code ...

        filtered_articles = fetch_articles(
            conn, 
            topics=topics, 
            date_min=date_min, 
            articles=articles,
            authors=authors,  # Pass the new filter
            offset=offset, 
            limit=limit
        )
        total_count = len(fetch_articles(
            conn, 
            topics=topics, 
            date_min=date_min, 
            articles=articles,
            authors=authors,  # Pass the new filter
            offset=0, 
            limit=999999
        ))
        return {"recommendations": filtered_articles, "total_count": total_count}
```

4. Finally, you'll need to update your frontend to include the new filter in the request payload. The request should now include the new `authors` field in the format:

```javascript
{
  "topics": [...],
  "articles": [...],
  "authors": [...],  // New filter
  "date_min": "...",
  "offset": 0,
  "limit": 20
}
```

This pattern can be repeated for any additional filters you want to add. The key steps are:

1. Add the new parameter to the `fetch_articles` function
2. Add the corresponding SQL conditions in the query
3. Update the `/api/recommendations` endpoint to pass the new filter
4. Update the `/api/articles/filter` endpoint to handle the new filter
5. Update your frontend to include the new filter in requests

Some additional tips:

- Always add proper validation for new filters
- Include debug logging for new filters
- Make sure to handle empty/null cases appropriately
- Consider adding the new filter to the MAB logging if you're using it
- Test the new filter thoroughly with various combinations of other filters
